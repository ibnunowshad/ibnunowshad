I started out building robust infrastructure, brick by brick. Then, the clouds rolled in, and I traded hammers for orchestration tools. Now, I'm not just an infrastructure pro, I'm a cloud whisperer, crafting secure, scalable solutions that dance in the sky.

No two projects are identical, like no two mountain trails are the same. I've trekked through complex migrations, scaled peaks of automation, and rappelled down security cliffs. Every challenge is a chance to learn, and my backpack overflows with expertise in design, migration, and more.

But work isn't my only Everest. When I'm not wrangling servers, I'm out on the open road, exploring new cultures and landscapes. Each journey fuels my passion for knowledge, and I bring that fresh perspective back to every project, keeping my skills as sharp as my trekking poles.

As with many situations, there will be no one right answer and typically, different people come up with different solutions. Architecting systems is a matter of weighing the pros and cons of various solutions and trying to find the best solution given requirements and constraints. 

Also, I'm a frugal, and I know how to write requirements. SaaS isn't the answer for everything.

I don't need the mid-sized Jeep, AWS, GCP, or Linode just yet for my usage. But, the VW Polo is okay for now. When required, I know how to lift and shift, migrate.

Also, it's fun to learn something new, like split-horizon DNS, super-subnetting, or even just good old serial to times before password management was even a twinkle in someone's eye.
