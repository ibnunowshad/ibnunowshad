I hold bachelor’s in information technology with project in security measures based on IEEE 2009 paper for SMS based 2FA. I have 10+ years of working experience in [Café Coffee Day](https://www.cafecoffeeday.com/), [Myntra](https://www.myntra.com/) _[(Flipkart)](https://www.flipkart.com/)_, [Dailyhunt](https://dailyhunt.in) _[(Verse)](https://verse.in/)_, [Lazada](https://lazada.com/) _[(Alibaba Group)](https://www.alibaba.com/)_, [Culfit](https://www.cult.fit/) as an architect, engineer, TPM in the past years. I setup processes, framework, and policies based on industry best practices to achieve desired outcome and yielded successful outcomes as byproduct.

My career path has been an adventure. I began by building solid infrastructure, one piece at a time. Then, the cloud revolution hit, and I swapped hammers for orchestration tools. Now, I'm more than just an infrastructure expert – I'm a cloud whisperer, crafting secure and scalable solutions that exist up in the cloud.

```
**Moving to the cloud requires a mindset change**
| On-premises               | Cloud                                  |
| -------------             | -------------                          |
| Buy machines              | Rent machines                          |
| Run machines for years    | Turn machines off as soon as possible  |
```



Every project is unique, just like no two hikes are the same. I've tackled complex migrations, scaled the heights of automation, and navigated the challenges of cloud security. Each obstacle has been a learning experience, and my backpack is overflowing with expertise in design, migration, and more.

But my life isn't all work and no play! When I'm not working on servers, I like to explore new places and cultures. These adventures keep me curious and bring fresh perspectives to every project, just like having sharp trekking poles helps on a hike!

As with many situations, there will be no one right answer and typically, different people come up with different solutions. Architecting systems is a matter of weighing the pros and cons of various solutions and trying to find the best solution given requirements and constraints. 

Also, I'm a frugal, and I know how to write requirements. SaaS isn't the answer for everything.

I don't need the mid-sized Jeep, AWS, GCP, or Linode just yet for my usage. But, the VW Polo is okay for now. When required, I know how to lift and shift, migrate.

Also, it's fun to learn something new, like split-horizon DNS, super-subnetting, or even just good old serial too times before password management was even a twinkle in someone's eye.

So, if you're ready to ditch the status quo and build a cloud kingdom beyond the horizon, let's climb together.
